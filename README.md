# Spam Message Classifier

This project is an interactive web application for real-time classification of spam messages.

## Overview

The Spam Message Classifier is a tool that allows users to input a message and determine whether it's likely to be spam or not. It utilizes a machine learning model trained on a dataset of spam and non-spam messages to make predictions in real-time.

## Features

- **Real-time Prediction**: Users can input a message and receive an instant prediction on whether it's spam or not.
- **Interactive Interface**: The application provides a user-friendly interface with clear instructions and feedback.

- **Model Performance**: The machine learning model has been trained on a diverse dataset and is optimized for accuracy.

## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: Used for building the interactive web application.
- **Python**: Programming language used for backend development and machine learning.
- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)**: Used for text preprocessing tasks such as tokenization, removing stopwords, and stemming.
- **Scikit-learn**: Used for machine learning model training and prediction.
- **Pickle**: Used for loading the trained model and TF-IDF vectorizer.
